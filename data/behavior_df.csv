2,Bulbasaur," While it sleeps, the seed on its back catches the rays and uses the energy to grow"
3,Bulbasaur,"In the wild, Bulbasaur tend to be very rare, as they are shy creatures that prefer the company of their own kind"
4,Bulbasaur," However, they are also generally very docile, tame, and loyal to people that they trust, and for that reason are one of the species of Pokémon available for starting trainers to choose in the region of Kanto"
0,Ivysaur,"Ivysaur are able to naturally learn the powerful Grass-type attack Solar Beam, a move whose execution time depends largely upon the weather; it takes an excruciatingly long amount of time to perform this attack in hail, rain, or a sandstorm, but nearly no time at all in bright sunlight"
1,Ivysaur," Luckily, the latter is ​most common in the habitats of these Pokémon, as it is vital that the bulbs on their backs receive ample sunlight so that they can photosynthesize and develop"
2,Ivysaur," As the bulbs grow larger and these Ivysaur become more powerful, they must spend increasing amounts of time in the sun in order to foster their growth"
3,Ivysaur," When Ivysaur are preparing to evolve into Venusaur, they will spend more time sunbathing and their bulbs will begin emanating a sweet, pleasant aroma"

3,Venusaur," With enough solar energy, the flowers on their backs can release a fragrance that calms both hostile Pokémon and people alike"

9,Charmeleon,This stage is often likened to a human’s teenage years--moody and reckless

2,Caterpie,"As weak, soft-bodied Pokémon, Caterpie attempt to gather as much energy as possible to hasten their evolutions into Metapod, and afterwards into Butterfree"

4,Metapod, They must remain upright while biding their time or risk spilling out their innards
5,Metapod,"They are often regarded as nearly useless in battle, as freshly-caught Metapod are incapable of damaging foes at all (other than by using Struggle)"
6,Metapod," Luckily, however, the Caterpie line undergoes some of the quickest evolutions known to date, and it does not take very long for Metapod to finally evolve into Butterfree"

4,Butterfree,"Because of their water-resistant wings, Butterfree can often be found fluttering about in the misty upper levels of rainforests"
5,Butterfree," However, the high moisture is not necessary for their survival; they are simply highly tolerant of it, so they are also found in drier forests as well, often flying in small swarms to search out locations where honey is abundant"
6,Butterfree, They sometimes compete with Cutiefly for territory
0,Weedle,The stingers and brightly colored bodies of these Pokémon are intended to ward off potential predators who would not enjoy a mouthful of toxins

2,Kakuna, Kakuna can only learn Harden naturally
3,Kakuna," When provoked, though, they can also extend poison barbs from their tips slightly to defend themselves"

5,Kakuna,"Their hard cocoons protect the soft bodies within, which essentially liquify as they reconfigure themselves for evolution"
6,Kakuna," This process, a fervor of activity that contrasts their immobility, causes their internal body temperatures to rise drastically, so much so that the shells of Kakuna nearing evolution feel uncomfortably hot to the touch"

0,Raticate,"Raticate remain just as much a nuisance to homeowners, only more aggressive"

0,Cranidos,"They dwelled in ancient tropical jungles about 100,000,000 years ago"

7,Cranidos," While able to attain high speeds, Cranidos require lots of room in order to accelerate properly"
8,Cranidos," In cramped areas, they become vulnerable due to their inability to headbutt at full speed"

5,Rampardos, Archaeological evidence shows that some ancient cultures in fact unearthed Rampardos skulls and used them as helmets in combat
6,Rampardos," Though popular culture often portrays Rampardos as having gone extinct due to their low intellect, most scientists agree that they died out during an ice age that killed off much of the currently existing life at the time; a cooling climate destroyed most of the tropical plants that they relied upon for survival"

3,Bastiodon, Bastiodon live in herds of 30 or so members
4,Bastiodon, They raise their young until adulthood
5,Bastiodon," When their herds are threatened, Bastiodon will line up side by side and barricade their offspring; these impregnable walls easily defend Shieldon from most predators"
6,Bastiodon," This defense, however, is notably weak to aerial attacks"
7,Bastiodon," Because their fossils are often found together, it is believed Bastiodon frequently clashed with Rampardos"
8,Bastiodon, Their facial bones are so hard and oddly shaped that scientists once thought they were sort of horn or spike until the first Bastiodon was successfully resurrected
9,Bastiodon," Despite their imposing size, Bastiodon are docile creatures"
10,Bastiodon, They spend most of their time traveling with their herds in search of Berries and grasses
11,Bastiodon," They are thought to have died out due to an ice age; the cooling climate wiped out many plants, and their sluggishness and herd reliance made remaining lone Bastiodon easy targets for predators"

10,Combee,Female Combee evolve into Vespiquen when they reach level 21; male Combee do not evolve

1,Vespiquen," Though capable of making honey, they rarely do so, relying on their Combee to bring back food for them"
2,Vespiquen," The six-celled undersides of their abdomens serve as nests for Combee grubs, which they (or rather, their workers) will protect at all costs"
3,Vespiquen," Conversely, the grubs will also protect their mothers with their lives"
4,Vespiquen, Much of the honey Vespiquen colonies collect goes towards feeding these offspring
5,Vespiquen," There is only one Vespiquen in a hive; should another female Combee evolve, it will immediately be exiled by the reigning queen to form a new colony"
6,Vespiquen, The primary job of a Vespiquen is to birth and protect new Combee
7,Vespiquen,"When their colonies falter, Vespiquen can produce pheromones to command their grubs to do their bidding; they can use Attack Order to wear down foes, Defend Order to strengthen their own defenses, or Heal Order to replenish energy"

7,Buizel, They wrap their tails around reeds when sleeping to stay anchored
0,Cherubi,"Despite its small size, Cherubi can often be seen nimbly dashing and jumping about"
1,Cherubi," This is because like Bounsweet, the Cherry Pokémon's  nutrient ball often causes it to be targeted by other Pokémon"
2,Cherubi," It's said to be very sweet and delicious, often causing bird Pokémon to attack it"
3,Cherubi," Starly in particular are notorious for preying upon Cherubi, as they sometimes try to peck the ball off"
4,Cherubi," Ironically, the ball detaches on its own when Cherubi sucks it dry of nutrients, so it becomes food for other Pokémon regardless of if it manages to escape predation"
5,Cherubi,"Otherwise, like many Grass type Pokémon, Cherubi loves to sunbathe"
6,Cherubi," It also has a tendency to hide in trees to escape being preyed on, especially Honey Trees"
7,Cherubi," In fact, they can be found hiding in said trees all over the Sinnoh region"
8,Cherubi," To lure them out, one must slather honey on the bark, enticing the Pokémon to feed"
