    1. This last model is not for grading purposes @SI630 graders, this one was just for fun and because I wanted to get my model as strong as possible! I got all of my materials in by Friday night :) 
    1. As you would expect, this got a perfect 1.000 F1 when tested on the Bulbapedia validation data, but I was more interested in how the annotation F1 score would change. It went from model 4's 0.306 to a 0.351 in model 5!
